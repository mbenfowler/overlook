## Abstract: 
Jobs that demand a large amount of travel demand a streamlined solution for those workers and their admin support teams to view booking data book their nightly lodgings. Enter: Overlook! - the no-frills booking web application for those with no extra time to nit-pick the details.

### User Stories: 
-  I should see a dashboard page that shows me:
  - Any room bookings I have made (past or upcoming)
  - The total amount I have spent on rooms
- I should be able to select a date for which Iâ€™d like to book a room for myself
  - Upon selecting a date, I should be shown a list of room details for only rooms that are available on that date
- I should be able to filter the list of available rooms by their roomType property
- I should be able to select a room for booking
  - In the event that no rooms are available for the date/roomType selected, display a message fiercely apologizing to the user and asking them to adjust their room search
- I can login to access my personal booking data
- Website is set up for accessibility
